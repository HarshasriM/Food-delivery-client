//class Component
-------------------
phases
-------------------
1.initializtion phase  = > component is created
2.Mounting = > (Jockey mounted on a horse) = > where does component get inserted
           = > tree = > DOM tree
           = > component should be inserted in DOM tree
3.updating = > props and state get changed our component gets updated
4.unmounting = > removing the component from DOM tree.

lifecycling methods
-------------------------

mounting = >
            componentWillMount = > before component inserted this method is called and mounting phase is happen
                              = >whenever we create constructor(component is created) in class this method is called internally.
            componentDidMount = > fetch calls are done in this method (it is called externally)

unmounting = > componentWillUnMount = > once this method is called immediately component is removed from the DOM tree

update = > componentWillUpdate,componentDidUpdate


>> everything in the class works under the method only

syntax or template for classcomponent creation
----------------------------------------------------
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class LifeCycleA extends Component {
    constructor(){
        super()
        this.state ={
            name:"sangeetha"
        }
        console.log("LifeCycleA constructor")
    }


    static getDerivedStateFromProps(){
       
        console.log("LifeCycleA getDerivedStateFromProps")
        return null
    }
    render() {
        console.log("LifeCycleA render")
        return (
            <div>
                LifeCycleA
                <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }

    componentDidMount(){
        console.log("LifecycleA componentDidMount")
    }
}

export default LifeCycleA;

Explanation:
---------------------------
render() is a method where we can return JSX
super() is going to call the component constructor
state is some variable

order of calling the methods is:
-----------------------------------------
1.constructor
2.getDerivedStateFromProps
3.render
4.componentDidMount
.. even though we change order in code calling methods is in above mention order

calling the created variables in constructor:
-------------------------------------------------
{this.state.varname}

>> to change the variable value in state(current value or current variable)
    ---- we use this.setstate({
    }) method

Types of webapplications
----------------------------
1.MultiPageApplication :
    * they give link to various html pages by linking through anchor tag
2.SinglePageApplication :
    * In a single html page they try to all respective component by hiding one component and try visible another component
    * using router concept we can achieve it.
    * Becoz of this routing concept only we can share the exact link.
    * routing is also secures our application.
    * router is not available in react. it is a third party package or dependency which we need to install and connect it to react

React router:
------------------------------
1.Hash router:
    *used in old Browsers
    * https://retail.onlinesbi.sbi/#
    '#' -- is called hash router
2.Browser router:
    https://hfref/bikf/
    '/' -- is called Browser router

>> there are two versions version 5 and version 6.

>>Routes is holding many route

node doesnot allow to access data from react so we install CORS to allow it
var cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors())
we will use these two in index .js in restaurantAPi in node


** when export default is given import syntax is:
    import temp from './temp'
** when export is given import syntax is:
    import {temp} from './temp'
------------------------------
classcomponent:
    we have to call constructor and super and in that constructor we call state object to set initialvalues
    we use setstate method to change those state values

function component:
    we have to set initialvalues by declaring our own variable and we use hooks to set those initialvalues
    here we create state for each for that we use useState() from hooks
    hooks----- function we need to import like component
    import React , {useState} from "react";


install -- npm i axios for fetch call
install -- npm i react-router-dom@5.0.0 for using Link component
install -- npm i react-tabs for creating tab components

# know about spread operator

#errors 
**punycode deprication error when nodemon is running becoz of new version od node js has not support this file
solution : goto trj6 folder in node_modules --> goto index.js --> const punycode = require("punycode/")
** when converting Json to javascript
  solutions:  always mongo returns json
    only json object can convert to javascript object and viceversa
    methods JSON to js:JSON.stringify(js object)
            js to JSON : JSON.parse(JSON object)

**rm /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   sudo service mongod status   -------------- commands when mongodb cant able to connect
   systemctl start mongod
   sudo service mongod status
